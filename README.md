## 🎨 Design System

Clean, professional design inspired by modern corporate tools:

- **Colors**: Neutral grays with subtle blue accents
- **Typography**: System fonts for optimal performance
- **Spacing**: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px scale for consistency
- **Components**: Minimal, functional UI components
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive without bloat

## 📊 Data Model

### Feature Entity

```typescript
interface Feature {
	id: string; // Unique identifier
	title: string; // Feature name
	description: string; // Detailed description
	impact: number; // Impact score (1-10)
	effort: number; // Effort estimate (1-10)
	category: FeatureCategory; // Mobile | Web | API | Infrastructure | Analytics
	status: FeatureStatus; // Planned | In Progress | Completed | On Hold
	quarter: string; // Target quarter (e.g., "2024-Q1")
	owner: string; // Responsible person/team
	createdAt: Date; // Creation timestamp
}
```

### Priority Calculation

Priority Score = `(Impact × 2 + (11 - Effort)) / 3`

This algorithm prioritizes high-impact, low-effort features while maintaining balance.
